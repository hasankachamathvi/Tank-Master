# 💧 Tank Master – IoT-Based Water Tank Management System

## Project Overview

**Tank Master** is an IoT-based smart water tank management system developed to automate water level monitoring, optimize water usage, and prevent overflow in households and institutions. The system integrates NodeMCU/ESP32 microcontrollers with ultrasonic sensors, flow sensors, relay modules, and solenoid valves to provide real-time water management.

Data is sent to **Firebase** for cloud storage and synchronization, while a **Flutter mobile app** allows users to monitor water levels, usage history, pump control, and receive notifications from anywhere.
